									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>While I am a Canadian born citizen, I do also hold United States citizenship. After living 6 years in Canada, my family and I moved to Australia and lived there for a year.
										After that my famliy and I have lived in Texas ever since.</p>

									<h3 class="major">High School</h3>
									<p>In high school I was never very strong in classes such as english and history. While i find history very fun to learn, when it came down to studying for tests, that I did not find as entertaining.
										on the other hand, math and science was where I excelled the most, not only because I believe I was more inclined to the STEM field, but because I was also very interested in the mechanics of math an science.
									</p>
									<p>
										For this reason, I began preparing for college by taking classes related more to engineering.
										I began understanding basics in engineering through taking classes that made me understand how to think like an engineer and also how to build structures digitally with programs like Inventor and AutoCad.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">College</h3>
									<p>I began my college experience at Texas Tech University studying Civil Engineering. There I took a Computational Thinking class where I learned the basics of Python. 
										While taking that class, I realized that I truly enjoying programming.</p>

									<p>
										I transferred to Concordia University Texas in Austin to play competitive soccer again, and due to the fact that they did not have any engineering programs, I thought it would be a great reason to pursue a computer science degree there instead.
									</p>
									<p>
										Playing soccer and studying computer science I believe gave me the tools necessary not only to succeed in the workplace, but to succeed in life as well.
										I am constantly developing my skills in any area possible. Playing soccer my whole life let me understand how to take constructive criticism and analyze areas of my game where I needed to improve. 
										Currently I am trying to add this concept of thinking to my professional career as I know this mindset will take me farther than I think I can go.
