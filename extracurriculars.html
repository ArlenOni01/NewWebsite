									<h3 class="major">Cooking</h3>
									<p>
										I always loved to cook for myself even at a young age. Before the end of grade 5 in elementary school, I would wake up early to prepare my breakfast and pack my lunch, thus saving my parents the time to do those things for me. 
										I did this all through Middle School to the end of my High School years. This culminated in my real love of cooking which began when I would stay up until very late at night just watching simple cooking videos and getting very intrigued with it as it was, to me, an art style. So when I came up with the idea of "Pangea", I felt as though the best way to reach out to people would be through my food. 
										Because after all, who doesn't love FOOD! My goal is to simply bring flavors from all around the globe together into one restaurant similarly to the way pangea was once all of the world in one land mass.
									</p>

									<p>
										I hope to one day be able to create an environment where people can appreciate al cultures through food to bring a divided world together.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Traveling</h3>
									<p>
										I am a firm believer that if there is one thing I enourage people to do with their money is travel. 
										I think the only way to truly experience life is to travel, see new and interesting things, and to meet people and engage in conversation.
										Over the years with increasing technology, I believe that the art of conversation has died, and through self traveling, being off of your phone and trying to talk to someone is something you cannot put a price on.

									<h3 class="major">Programming</h3>
									<p>
										Despite programming being a very new and challenging area I am venturing into, I am learning to enjoy the failures of my work so that I can learn and grow as I continue to pursue a career in computer science.
