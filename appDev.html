								<h2>App Development</h2>
								<p>After taking an App Development class in college, I found it quite interesting about the possibility of me having my own app that can help people, but I had to figure out <b>HOW</b> I wanted to help people first.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>
										Towards the end of my time in college, I realized that I was putting my fitness on the back burner and focusing solely on finishing my degree.
										I came to realize this when I realized it was getting consistently more difficult to do simple things like getting out of bed in the morning or walking up long flights of stairs.
										After realizing this I began to ask myself what was missing from my life, and I realized that I was missing a lot of mobility in my life which cause me to find it difficult to do simple movements.
									</p>
									<p>
										This lead me to create my fitness app (still do not know what to call it) to store the ways that people can improve their mobility and overall way of life. 
										Because for me, I am a firm believer that the way your body feels, your soul will mimic that feeling. Which is why in The Bible it says that your body is a temple and should be treated as such.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Fitness App</h3>
									<p>
										The goal of my fitness app is to  help people with their overall mobility, and provide informaation for people to work on their athletic performance by specifically help people work on their reaction times.
										With the timer I have designed for this application, it allows people to work on their reaction time when a coach is not available to test it for them.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whether you want to learn what you need to do to loosen up your muscles and joints, or if you want to learn how to be faster, the information can now be consolidated in one area.
