										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p> Born in Canada, to Nigerian parents, I have lived, gone to school, and played competitive sports in Canada, Australia, and the United States. 
											My primary focus now is a career in Computer Science specifically in Software/Data Engineering. 
											I have a relentless hunger to learn and succeed. My ability to communicate with people from various backgrounds comes from my experience of living, schooling, and playing sports with people from different cultural environments. 
											The impact I bring to the workplace and groups of people is instant due to my drive to excel.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Career</h2>
										<p>Beginning my journey in Computer Science was quite a difficult one. 
											It has been a challenge to find the right people to learn from online or in my general schooling. 
											I have begun submerging myself into properly understanding how to program. 
											In college, I was primarily looking towards development in Python, however, now I am focusing on undeerstanding how to combine languages based off of their unique capabilities.
											Here you will find all of the things I have done, currently working on, or trying to learn to grow my knowledge.

										<h2 class="major">Extracurriculars</h2>
										<p>
											In my spare time I enjoy doing various things like cooking, playing soccer, and working out. 
											From recent memory, winning the ASW conference with Concordia Men's Soccer, for the first time in program history, was one of my proudest achievements. 
											Coming in as a transfer student to be the second string goalkeeper and then save the conference winning penalty in the final stamped my name in the school's history and was a moment I surely will not soon forget.
											In my other spare time, I display my skills on instagram to show people what I can also do in the kitchen.
