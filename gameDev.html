								<p>Gaming is one of the greatest forms of art that the world has to offer. Playing new games gave me a great interest in the way that games are created and developed.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>
										My whole life, I grew up playing soccer related games like FIFA or PES, and only up to the past few years did I begin playing story-mode games with stories that go in-depth.
										Games like <i>Uncharted, The Last Of Us, Spiderman, Arkham Knight,</i> and <i>God of War</i> opened my eyes to the great works that some of these gaming companies can do.

											<h3 class="major">The Last Of Us Series</h3>
											<p>Who does not love a post apocalyptic world based off of the father daughter love that two strangers grow amongst each other while fighting off sick people know as <i>Infected</i>.</p>

											<h3 class="major">God Of War: Ragnarok</h3>
											<p>My love for Greek Mythology made playing this game easy when also coupling that witht the amazing character development through both characters.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Game Development</h3>
									<p>
										I began developing my own game in the summer of 2022 as a side project of mine. 
										I wanted to be able to have something of some merit that was mine that was worth something related to the field that I want to go in to. 
										Using the Unity engine, I coded a game in C# and used 2D tile-maps to construct a dungeon-esque game where the objective of the game is to go around the map, solving riddles and defeating enemies. 
										Once you have solved all of the riddles, then you have beaten the game.
