								<h2>Career</h2>
								<p>
									Throughout my life, my search for knowledge has always been an important one for me.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am very interested to know various ways to code so that I will be able to translate different methodologies into the work I will put in at my next job.

									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>
										My father graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree and my mother is a Tax Consultant. 
										From both of them I gained a strong brain for math and science. So when it came down to choosing a major for college, engineering seemed like the right thing to do.
									</p>

									<p>
										After my first year studying Civil Engineering at Texas Tech University, I took a computational thinking class and enjoyed it very much, which led me to switch to study Computer Science at Concordia University Texas.
										Due to the fact that I went to a small school with limited resources, I knew I needed to do extra work on my own to try and have some sort of credibility when applying for internships.
									</p>

									<p>
										In order to gain more expereince, I decided to dive into various projects that would help me understand what it means to be a programmer. 
										And with that hard work, it led me to landing my first real working experience in the tech world working at Schrodinger, Inc. in New York City.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Data Engineering</h3>
									<p>
										Data Engineering for me is a new area I am venturing into. 
										Recently I have gone through an intensive data engineering bootcamp at an oil and gas company called EOG Resources in Houston, Texas where I learned valuable information about what it means to be a data engineer. 
										I learned the language SQL through Oracle as well as developed the backend technology that goes into developing fast API services for the apps that this company would use for people who needed to access the data of the oil wells that they needed.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am now working to understand more concepts that will build on my current knowledge of data engineering. I am looking into Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Snowflake, Apache Kafka, Data Lakes, etc. 
										I hope to translate the work I learned at EOG to my next job to showcase the skills that I have gained.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Game Development</h3>
									<p>
										I began developing my own game in the summer of 2022 as a side project of mine. 
										I wanted to be able to have something of some merit that was mine that was worth something related to the field that I wanted to go in to. 
										Using the Unity engine, I coded a game in C# and used 2D tile-maps to construct a dungeon-esque game where the objective of the game is to go around the map, solving riddles and defeating enemies. 
										Once you have solved all of the riddles, then you have beaten the game.

									<h3 class="major">App Development</h3>
									<p>
										I found interest in developing apps when I took an app development class in college my senior year. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I thought that creating a fitness app was a great way to start as it is something that I am passionate about while also something that I believe can help people in very simple ways.
