									Cooking is an art form that I have grow to appreciate over my life time.

									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>
										Before the end of grade 5 in elementary school, I would wake up early to prepare my breakfast and pack my lunch, thus saving my parents the time to do those things for me.
										I did this all through Middle School to the end of my High School years. 
										This culminated in my real love of cooking which began when I would stay up until very late at night just watching simple cooking videos and getting very intrigued with it as it was, to me, an art style. 
									</p>
									<p>	
										So when I came up with the idea of "Pangea", I felt as though the best way to reach out to people would be through my food. 
										Because after all, who doesn't love <b>FOOD!</b> My goal is to simply bring flavors from all around the globe together into one restaurant similarly to the way pangea was once all of the world in one land mass.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Favorite Dishes</h3>
									<p>It is difficult to say what my favorite dishes are, but my favorite cuisine to experiment with is probably latin cusine, just because I love the explosion of flavor that come with the spicy and tangy ingredients the cuisine has to offer.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Goals</h3>
									<p>
										As I am still learning the inticacies of being a chef, I aspire to be able to understand the ways that various cultures use their techniques, show them to the world, and then be able to combine these techniques across various cultures to show how we as humans can all combine with each other.

											<h3 class="major">Steak Sandwich</h3>
											<p>The first thing I ever cooked that took a while was a steak sandwich on garlic bread, and to this day is probably one of my favorite things to cook.</p>
